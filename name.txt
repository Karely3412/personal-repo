My name is Karely Partida.

** Workflow **
- New repo:
> git init
> Worked on our changes
> git add
> git commit -m "inital commit" OR "first commit"
-- Remote (Github)
> Login
> Create a Repository (named same or similar to local project)
> Go back to the local repo, add remote, change master branch to main, push commit historty
    >> (copied commands from github, paste into terminal) 
> git push -u origin main (whatever the main branch was named) ALSO origin main will also be up stream branch which is the main branch in the repository you created.



- Working Repository:
  --Local 
> If this is a new feature:
 > git checkout -b <branch-name>
 > Development
 > git add .
 > git commit -m "explicit but short message explaining changes" Exam: "adds workflow. changes name. formats name.txt"
 > git push -u <origin or remote> <branch-name> (after the second push there's no need to add "-u origin <branch-name>")
> Current feature:
> git add .
> git commit -m "<message>"
> git push


** Helpful
> git status
